## 🗄️ Database Changes

### New Migration: `add_missing_fields_to_memorials_table`

Added 8 new columns to `memorials` table:
```
species, breed, date_of_birth, date_of_passing,
biography, favorite_memory, personality, settings
```

**Purpose:** Align database schema with application features

---

## 🔐 Security Implemented

### Memorial Policy
- **View:** Public memorials = everyone, Private = owner only
- **Update:** Owner only
- **Delete:** Owner only

### Route Protection
All editing and moderation routes require authentication:
```php
Route::middleware(['auth'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('/memorials/{memorial}/edit', EditMemorial::class);
    Route::get('/tributes/moderate', TributeModeration::class);
});
```

---

## 🎨 UI Improvements

### Navigation
Added "Tributes" link for authenticated users:
```
Dashboard | Tributes | Create Memorial
```

### Dashboard
Edit button now functional:
```blade
<a href="{{ route('memorials.edit', $memorial) }}">Edit</a>
```

### Tribute Moderation Page
- Professional card-based layout
- Clear action buttons
- Status indicators
- Responsive design
- Dark mode support

---

## 🐛 Bugs Fixed

1. **Schema Mismatch:** Aligned field names (`companion_name` → `pet_name`, `is_public` → `visibility`)
2. **Tribute Fields:** Fixed `author_*` → `submitter_*` field names
3. **Privacy Checks:** Updated all visibility checks to use correct column
4. **Date Formatting:** Fixed Carbon parsing in dashboard view

## 💡 Key Technical Decisions

### File Storage
- **Choice:** Local `public` disk
- **Reason:** Simple, works out of the box
- **Future:** Migrate to S3 for scalability

### Email Queue
- **Choice:** Async with `ShouldQueue`
- **Reason:** Don't block user requests
- **Driver:** `sync` (dev), `database` (production)

### Authorization
- **Choice:** Laravel Policies
- **Reason:** Clean, testable, maintainable
- **Implementation:** `MemorialPolicy` with explicit methods

### Livewire
- **Choice:** Standard Livewire (not Volt)
- **Reason:** Better stability, clearer separation
- **Pattern:** Class-based components with separate views
