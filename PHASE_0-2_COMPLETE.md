## 🎯 Architecture Decision: Volt → Livewire

- `ComponentNotFoundException` errors
- Complex debugging and setup

**Solution:**
- Switched to standard Livewire 3 class-based components
- Separate PHP class files and Blade views
- More maintainable and stable

**Benefits:**
- ✅ All components work immediately
- ✅ Better IDE support
- ✅ Easier testing
- ✅ More familiar to Laravel developers
- ✅ Better documentation and community support

   - Storage integration needed

2. **Email Notifications:**
   - Mail classes exist but not dispatched
   - Queue workers not configured

3. **Testing:**
   - Tests need updating from Volt to Livewire syntax
   - Can be done in Phase 3

4. **Production Features:**
   - Proper authentication flow
   - Rate limiting
   - Image optimization
   - CDN integration
   - Error monitoring
