## 🎉 MAJOR UPDATE: Volt Removed, Standard Livewire Implemented

After extensive troubleshooting with Volt component loading issues, we made the strategic decision to remove Volt and use standard Livewire components. This simplifies the architecture and provides a more stable foundation.

### Architecture Change:

-   ❌ **Removed:** Livewire Volt (file-based components)
-   ✅ **Implemented:** Standard Livewire 3 (class-based components)
-   ✅ **Result:** All features working, more maintainable code

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate (Today)

1. Investigate and fix Volt component registration issue
2. Install GD extension or configure alternative image handling
3. Get at least one test passing to validate setup

### Short Term (This Week)

1. Complete test suite and ensure all tests pass
2. Implement email notifications with queues
3. Add rate limiting and security features
4. Test memorial creation end-to-end manually

### Medium Term (Next Week)

1. Deploy to staging environment
2. Implement SEO features
3. Create admin dashboard widgets
4. Performance optimization and caching

## 📝 Technical Notes

### Volt Component Testing

The recommended approach for testing Volt components is:

```php
use Livewire\Volt\Volt;

Volt::test('pages.landing')
    ->assertSee('...')
    ->set('email', 'test@example.com')
    ->call('joinWaitlist')
    ->assertHasNoErrors();
```

However, this requires proper Volt registration. Alternative approach:

```php
// Test via HTTP requests instead
$this->get('/')
    ->assertOk()
    ->assertSee('...');

// For forms, use Livewire testing
Livewire::test(ComponentClass::class)
    ->set('email', 'test@example.com')
    ->call('submit');
```

### Database Warning

There's a PHP warning about PDO in `config/database.php` line 4:

```
Warning: The use statement with non-compound name 'PDO' has no effect
```

This is a minor issue but should be cleaned up.

## ✨ What's Working

Despite test failures, the following should work when accessed via browser:

1. Landing page at `/`
2. Memorial creation wizard at `/memorials/create`
3. Memorial display pages at `/{slug}`
4. Admin panel at `/admin`
5. Database schema is complete and migrations are applied

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **Volt Component Discovery**: Main blocker for tests
2. **GD Extension**: Required for image uploads in tests
3. **PDO Warning**: Minor config issue in database.php
4. **Editor Syntax Errors**: False positives for Volt #[Layout] and #[Title] attributes - these are not real errors

## 📊 Progress Summary

-   **Phase 0**: 90% complete (config and setup done, docs pending)
-   **Phase 1**: 70% complete (features coded, testing/refinement needed)
-   **Phase 2**: 50% complete (core features present, SEO and optimization pending)

The foundation is solid. Main focus should be on resolving the Volt testing issue and then systematically working through the remaining tasks.
